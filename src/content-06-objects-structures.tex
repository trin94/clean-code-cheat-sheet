\section{Objects and Structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do not create hybrids of objects and structures
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects hide their internals
        \item Structures expose their internals
    \end{itemize}
    \item Follow the Law of Demeter: method $f$ of class $C$ should only call other functions of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C$
        \item An object created by $f$
        \item An object passed as an argument to $f$
        \item An object held in an instance variable of $C$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Avoid long method call chains
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might violate the Law of Demeter
    \end{itemize}
