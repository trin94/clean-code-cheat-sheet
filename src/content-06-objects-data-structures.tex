\section*{Objects and Structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chose between objects and structures
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data
        \item Data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions
    \end{itemize}
    \item Be careful when using objects: objects
    \begin{itemize}
        \item make it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions
        \item make it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change
    \end{itemize}
    \item Be careful when using structures: structures
    \begin{itemize}
        \item make it easy to add new functions without changing the structure
        \item make it hard to add new structures because all the functions must change
    \end{itemize}
    \item Do not create hybrids of objects and structures
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects hide their internals
        \item structures expose their internals
        \item hybrids combine the disadvantages of both approaches
    \end{itemize}
    \item Follow the Law of Demeter: method $f$ of class $C$ should only call other functions of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C$
        \item An object created by $f$
        \item An object passed as an argument to $f$
        \item An object held in an instance variable of $C$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Avoid long method call chains
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might violate the Law of Demeter
        \item Split them up
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
