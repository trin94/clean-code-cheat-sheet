\section{Concurrency}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Separate concurrency from application logic
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Concurrency is complex enough to have its own reason to change
    \end{itemize}
    \item Restrict the number of critical sections
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduced guard code
        \item Reduced probability of failures and forgotten protections
    \end{itemize}
    \item Keep the synchronized sections small
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For better performance
    \end{itemize}
    \item Consider duplicating objects instead of synchronizing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Costs need to be inspected individually
    \end{itemize}
    \item Know your tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Thread safe data structures
        \item Common execution models: producer/consumer, readers/writers, dining philosophers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Investigate "one-off" errors
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are no one-off errors
        \item One-off errors point to a faulty system
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create nonthreaded code first
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This will separate error chasing in threaded and nonthreaded sections as well
    \end{itemize}
    \item Test threaded code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Varying conditions: one thread, several threads, more threads than cores
        \item Multiple times
        \item On different platforms
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
