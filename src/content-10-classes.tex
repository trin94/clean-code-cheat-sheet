\section*{Classes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make classes small
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One responsibility per class
        \item Responsibility $=$ "reason to change"
        \item If it's hard to find a fitting name, the class is too large
        \item Words like \textit{Processor}, \textit{Manager} or \textit{Super} hint at an aggregation of responsibilities
        \item It should be possible to create a description of a class in about 25 words
    \end{itemize}
    \item Increase cohesion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It means that parts of a class are a logical unit
        \item Functions operate on multiple instance variables
        \item When classes lose cohesion, split them (if there is a set of variables only used by a subset of methods)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fix broken classes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Only if something needs to be changed or added
        \item "In an ideal system, we incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications to existing code."
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use interfaces to decouple tight relations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improves testability, flexibility and understandability
        \item Dependency Inversion Principle: classes should depend upon abstractions not concrete details
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
