\textit{Follow the four rules of Simple Design: a design is simple if it}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Runs all the tests
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tests verify that a system is as simple as it looks on paper
        \item Writing tests leads to looser coupling and high cohesion
        \item Writing tests leads to better designs in general
    \end{itemize}
    \item Contains no duplicate code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Less maintenance
        \item Violations of the Single Response Principle will become visible
    \end{itemize}
    \item Expresses the intent of the programmer
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Keeping things small enables better naming of components
    \end{itemize}
    \item Minimizes the number of classes and methods
    \begin{itemize}
        \item But it's more important to have tests, eliminate duplication and to have clean code
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
