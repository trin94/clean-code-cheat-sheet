\section{Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider wrapping third-party code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Keeps code separated
        \item Allows swapping libraries
        \item First-party: want code that is focused on particular need
        \item Third-party: want code that strives to broad applicability
        \item At least do not pass third-party interfaces around
    \end{itemize}
    \item Control the boundaries
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interfaces are great for boundaries with third-party or non-existing first-party code
        \item System can be designed without worrying about the ``other'' code
        \item Allow only few points of contact with third party code
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
